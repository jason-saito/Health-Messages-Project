# Health-Messages-Project by Jason Saito & Nora Wollen
Welcome to our Health Messages project! We're utilizing Generative AI to make anti-underage vaping social media campaigns. You can choose to either read the full report in the "whole report.pdf" or explore the index.ipynb notebook.

Our campaign is called Fresh Air Futures, and we are looking to target a young, teenage audience that has fallen into the addiction to vaping. In our project, we targeted our audience by being relatable. We included images and writing to point out and rebuttal peer pressure, candy-flavored vape products, and marketing strategy to open the eyes of young people to the dangers of vaping hiding behind the pretty packaging and cool look. 

A Fresh Air Future is a future where young people can prosper- where they can live a healthy and fulfilling life. Fresh Air Futures is a project for the youth. We used shocking images to catch the eye of young people who vape and make them rethink their decisions. Our goal is to reach our audience, and allow them to make the life-changing decision to stop vaping for their health.
